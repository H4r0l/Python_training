# Python Training Exercises

Welcome to my Python Training repository! Here, I'll be uploading exercises to practice and improve my Python skills.

Each exercise will have its own directory, containing the exercise description and related files.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to an exercise directory.

3. Read the exercise description in the comments of the file.

4. Solve the exercise by creating/editing Python files.

5. Test your solution and ensure it works.

6. Commit and push your changes to the repository.
* _Not necessary if you do not intend to do it progressively_

Happy coding!
